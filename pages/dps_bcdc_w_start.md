## How to become a provider to the Catalogue

To become a Catalogue editor/publisher for a Sub-Organization (a Branch or Division), one needs the sub-org to exist or be created and an grants applied to your account.

+ See [roles and responsibilities](./dsg_bcdc_roles_responsibilities.md) for expectations on what it is to be a provider, data custodian, steward or data manager. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32690119/179629726-b3c25bfc-c385-45d3-ade2-b5252da9e667.png)

To start please log into the [Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/) or have others who you will request access on behalf of.
+ This will populate the catalogue with all your contact details.

Then to request a grant to your account please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/3).
+ This request service also allows for other account actions.

Requests can be made for yourself or on behalf of others.

**In this request we ask for the following information:**

1. Subject: "BCDC Account" + additional details - will aid for quick triaging
2. Full name and email
3. IDIR
    + This can be a user IDIR or a Service IDIR
    + A Service IDIR may be ideal for the maintenance workflow to script against the catalogue API.
4. Name of the Ministry or if a Broader Public Sector
5. Name of your Branch/Division - this is usually the level associated with an ED or Director.
6. Approval from the [Data Custodian](./dsg_bcdc_roles_responsibilities.md#the-data-custodian) (Director or Executive Director).

A Catalogue administrator will then action your request and contact you with all relevant information to get you started as an Editor in the BC Data Catalogue.

### How to become a Provider for another Organization

It is common for organizations to have staff who work in other Sub-Organizations or branches who steward their data. There may be many reasons for this.

* Therefore [Stewards](./dsg_bcdc_roles_responsibilities.md#the-data-steward) can become providers to the catalogue on behalf of another sub-organization's [Data Custodian](./dsg_bcdc_roles_responsibilities.md#the-data-custodian).

* To be granted access, is the same as the information outlined on [how to get access above](#how-to-become-a-provider-to-the-catalogue) but is useful to include that the editor will be steward.

Metadata Groups provide a listing of like datasets for a specific purpose and can contain records from across multiple organizations.
+ These are not intended to replace a full listing of records for a sub-organization.
+ Groups by default are public but a request them to be visible to IDIR only can be made.

To create a group, please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/23) and include in the description:

**Requirements:**
+ **Group name**:

+ **URL**: _for more information_

### Contact details

All records require one visible contact to the public, and at times this is their generic inbox. However we do recommend that additional contacts be listed which may require logging into the Catalogue to see.

It is the responsibility of the org listed as Published by to maintain their records but at times the contact listed is unreachable, for example they have left government or retired. Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/23) and the link of the metadata record for which the contact is not available
