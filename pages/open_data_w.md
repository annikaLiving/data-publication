# HOW TO ASSOCIATE DATA TO BC'S OPEN DATA LICENCE
It is recommended to publish data under an Open Government Licence, where possible, as it is much more permissive.

This document is intended for BC Government employees to follow to apply our open data licence to datasets that are under their authority.

Broader Public Sector (BPS) agencies are required to [create their own licence](open_data_licence_create.md) but are welcome to publish data in the BC Data Catalogue (BCDC).
* Refer to the [BCDC documentation](dps_bcdc.md)

## REVIEW THE OPEN DATA POLICY
Before starting the process review the [Open Information and Open Data Policy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/information-management-technology/information-privacy/resources/policies-guidelines/open-information-open-data-policy.pdf).

## REVIEW THE OPEN GOVERNMENT LICENCE - BRITISH COLUMBIA
Review the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia (OGL-BC)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61) to ensure the licence is correct for the needs of the business and data. 

## ENSURE THE DATA IS IN AN OPEN FORMAT
Data can be released in multiple formats but at least one must be in an __open format__, e.g., 
- CSV, 
- Shape File (SHP), 
- JSON,
- GeoPackage,
- or additional formats noted by the OCIO’s [Open Data Physical Dataset Format Standard](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/open_data_physical_dataset_extract.pdf). 

For guidelines on [open format file content](dsg_bcdc_file_based_content.md).

## BC DATA CATALOGUE METADATA RECORDS
All datasets under the OGL-BC require a metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue (BCDC), aka, the Catalogue.

Regardless if a dataset is under the OGL, any BC Government or Broader Public Sector (BPS) dataset can be published in the BCDC.

To obtain an __account__ and publish metadata records follow the [BCDC documentation](dps_bcdc.md) and the [Where to Start](dps_bcdc_w_start.md).

## COMPLETE AND SUBMIT THE OPEN DATA ASSESSMENT AND CHECKLIST
The [Open Data Assessment and Checklist](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/97CF56DB283D4AE08968E4A4C7538D65) must be completed and the appropriate people contacted.

The checklist ensures the following:
### That the data contains __no personal information__.

### That the __province has the intellectual property__ of the data.
This is to be __confirmed by__ contacting the [Intellectual Properties Office (QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca)](mailto:QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca) and will asking questions around the data and will ask for a copy of the data.
+ Recommend sending them the data in a format they can open, like csv or xlsx.
+ If the data is huge, a subset of rows can also be provided.

Data Creation:
+  Has the dataset been created solely by BC government employees?  If no, you will need to provide further details of the creation of the dataset, such as: 
 + Was the dataset created by:
  + contractors on behalf of government (in which case we would need to review the contract); or  
  + by another third party (we would need to know the terms under which the province can use the created dataset). 

Data Source(s):
+ Is the data contained in the dataset BC government-owned data? 
+ Is the data (or any of the data) derived from a third-party source? Broader public sector such as crown corporations, health authorities and public post-secondary institutions are external to core government and are separate legal entities for the purposes of copyright ownership. 
+ If the data is third-party sourced:  
 + Does the dataset comprise of direct reproduction of a sizable “chunk” of data in the same organized structure as the source of the data?  
 + Has the source data been further manipulated (mathematical computation run to create new numbers, been reformatted into different columns/rows, etc.)? 

Restrictions of Use:
+ Did the province gain access to the data under a contractual arrangement that may restrict further distribution and licensing of the data to third parties?   
+ Has the data been exclusively licensed to a third party (precluding the province from being able to license the data to others, including under the OGL-BC)? 

### That the data is __not under any legal, contractual or policy constraint__.

### That the data is __publicly releasable__.
This is to be __confirmed by__ contacting the [Ministry Information Security Officer (MISO)](https://intranet.gov.bc.ca/intranet/content?id=DC4623F6F1944065B83F70297ED419D7).
 + A Ministry MISO may also have their own set of questions.

### That the data is __not currently for sale__.

## SIGNATURES
Signatures are required from the following:
1. The Data Custodian
1. The Custodial organization’s Deputy Minister or designated alternate.

Accepted signatures can be by signing and scanning the Open Data Assessment and Checklist or from an e-approval process the ministry has in place.

## REVIEW WITH THE MINISTRY GOVERNMENT COMMUNICAITON OFFICER
We recommend working with your Government Communication Officer around the release of a dataset under this licence.

## WHO TO CONTACT FOR FINAL PUBLICATION
The completed form as well as questions are to be directed to the DataBC Program Services Team you are working with in regard to publishing data.

If you haven't started this process,  please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/28).

## MAINTAINANCE
Data should be continually updated and maintained. The life cycle of a datasets may also include retirement and archiving.
