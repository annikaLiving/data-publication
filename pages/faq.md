## DATA PUBLICATION LICENSING OPTIONS - OPEN DATA/ACCESS ONLY

### What is Open Data and what is the difference between Open Data and "Access Only" public data?

The following sections will help explain the difference between **Open Data** and **Access Only** public data.

#### What does **Open Data** mean?

+ "_Open Data_ is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control" - [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data)

#### What does **Access Only** mean?

+ For the reproduction of materials found in the [_BC Data Catalogue_](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/), either a licence agreement (as specified in the BC Data Catalogue) will apply, or the materials are _Access Only_ and reproduction is not permitted without written permission.
+ To request permission, please complete the [_Copyright Permission Request Form_](https://forms.gov.bc.ca/copyright-permission-request/). 
   + If a licence agreement applies, permission is subject to the terms of the specified licence.
   
#### What does **Crown Copyright** mean?

+ Crown copyright is a form of copyright claim used by the governments of a number of Commonwealth realms. It provides special copyright rules for the Crown, i.e. government departments and (generally) state entities - [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_copyright#:~:text=Crown%20copyright%20is%20a%20form,and%20(generally)%20state%20entities.).
+ You can find information about Crown Copyright on this [_BC Government website_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home/copyright).  

### Why should I consider publishing data under an open data licence?

+ Licensing data as _Open_ increases the likelihood that the public will benefit from the data, either directly or by using applications that can use the data.
+ As explained on [_this site_](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/starting.html#benefits), licensing data as _Open_ increases transparency, improves public service and increases efficiency, and contributes to innovation and public service. 

### Can all data be licensed as Open?

+ No, there are some restrictions, as explained in the [_Assessment and Checklist_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) referred to in the next question.  

### How do I publish data as Open Data?

+ Datasets, under the Intellectual Property of the Province of B.C., may be eligible to be licensed under the [_Open Government Licence - British Columbia (OGL-BC)_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).
+ To license a dataset as _Open Data_ you will need to contact multiple people to authorize the dataset to be made available under the OGL-BC. The [_Assessment and Checklist_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) document includes the following resources (plus others):
   + Your [_Ministry Information Security Officer_](https://intranet.gov.bc.ca/intranet/content?id=DC4623F6F1944065B83F70297ED419D7)
   + The [_Intellectual Properties Office_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=4F03158C0AF84EC08DBB5BE3E873C33E) - email [QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca](mailto:QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca)
+ Data can be licensed under OGL-BC after:
   + The authorizations described above have been made, and the [_Assessment and Checklist_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) has been signed off from your Deputy Minister or designated alternate.
   + The dataset is made available in an open format, e.g., CSV, Shape File (SHP), JSON. 
      + Additional formats are noted in the [_OCIO's Open Data Physical Dataset Format Standard_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/open_data_physical_dataset_extract.pdf). 
	  + Note that the DataBC Data Distribution facilities automatically make downloadable data available in open formats. Regardless of licence, people uploading data in proprietary formats (e.g., Excel) directly to the BC Data Catalogue are encouraged to provide datasets in an open data format (e.g., csv) as well.
   + A BC Data Catalogue (BCDC) metadata record for the dataset, linking to the appropriate Open Data Licence, has been created. 
      + To obtain an account for the BCDC, approval from the dataset's Data Custodian is required; the custodian may be a Director or Executive Director of the Branch responsible for maintaining the dataset.

### Are there restrictions on how data licensed under OGL-BC can be used?

+ Yes, this is explained in [_the licence_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).

### How do I publish data as Open Data if I am a Crown Corporation or BC Agency?

+ The Broader Public Sector (BPS) cannot use the OGL-BC and thus require their own open data licence. See [How to Become a Provider to the Catalogue](dps_bcdc_w.md#how-to-become-a-provider-to-the-catalogue) for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------

## METADATA RECORDS AND THE BC DATA CATALOGUE

### How do I publish Metadata Records in the BC Data Catalogue as a Crown Corp or BC Agency?

+ As a member of the Broader Public Sector (BPS) you may manage your own holdings within the BC Data Catalogue.
+ To start this process, please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/5/create/16) with the subject as **Dataset Publication as a Crown Corp or BC Agency** and provide as much detail as possible in the description.  

### How do I get authorization to publish records in the BC Data Catalogue?

+ To obtain an account to publish and manage data and metadata records for data, applications and services, approval from the Custodian is required. The custodian may be a Director or Executive Director of a Branch.
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/3/create/13) for a new account.

### How do I change the contact name recorded for a dataset when that contact has moved to a different role or retired?

+ Each BC Data Catalogue record is required to list at least one contact within the business area.
+ The custodian of the dataset can authorize one or more people to be editors of their records. 
   + These editors can then change the contact information. 
   + Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/3) to have editors set up for BC Data Catalogue access.
   
### How do I change the branch or ministry name or move a branch that has moved to another ministry listed in the catalogue?

+ Organizations regularly change names or move to other ministries as functions shift.
+ A custodian of a branch or an already delegated editor of an organization can inform us of any organizational change. 
   + The administrator of the catalogue can rename and move organizations around. 
   + Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/23) to update the organizatonal structure for your Ministry or Branch/Division.**

### Can I do bulk changes to Catalogue records?

+ Bulk changes are when over **20** records need the same action, e.g.,
   + Change a contact from one person to another
   + Change a resource or more information link to a new URL
   + Change a record from one state to another, e.g., Pending Archive to Archive or push a Published record back to Draft.
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/23) for bulk changes in the BC Data Catalogue.**

### How do I add/updated descriptions or short names of fields at the bottom of a metadata record for data in the BCGW?

+ These field descriptions and short names (for Shapefiles) all come from the BC Geographic Warehouse system metadata.
+ To update these, we require the object name, field name and the new definition for the Description or Short Name.
   + If there are multiple datasets or a large number of columns, we can prepare an export to use.
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/23) to make changes to the data model.

### Why would I just upload a tabular dataset to the BC Data Catalogue instead of publishing it to the BCGW?

+ As an alternative to publishing to the BCGW, tabular datasets (CSV, text files, and Excel spreadsheets) smaller than 150MB can be uploaded directly to the Data Catalogue. 

+ The following table summarizes the benefits of each of the two options:

|Feature|BC Data Catalogue|BC Geographic Warehouse|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Has a metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue|Yes|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded in their entirety|Yes|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded by specified area|No|Yes|
|Datasets larger than 150 MB can be stored|No|Yes|
|Datasets can be uploaded/stored free of charge|Yes|_Sometimes_|
|Datasets can be secured for viewing or download by only named users|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be available in BC Map Hub|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be permanent layers in iMapBC and the Layer Library|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be available through WMS/WFS services|No|Yes| 

### How can I find my related datasets in the Catalogue?

+ Navigate to the organization you are an editor for
    +  https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/organization
    +  To see what organizations you are an editor for:
        + Easy way is to click `Add Dataset` and under `Published by` you can see all orgs.
        + Or you can log into the catalogue and see a csv of all editors [BC Data Catalogue Content - All Records](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/60a78043-36da-4547-8f11-17254f837d36)
+ Search for your name in the Catalogue search bar to view datasets where you are listed as a contact.

## IMAPBC AND LAYER LIBRARY LAYER PRESENTATIONS

### How do I update a layer presentation for my dataset?

+ A custodial business area representative can import the layer file from the Layer Library available via:
   + the TSAT toolbar available in ArcMap on the GTS ArcGIS Desktop, or
   + the [_Layer Library folder_](\\data.bcgov\layer_library) directly (must have read access) to load into ArcMap   
      + If this is not available to you, the layer file can be sent to you.
   + Make the changes, as per the [_Layer File Presentation_](dsg_bcgw_layer_file_presentation.md) standards
   + Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/5/create/31) and attach the layer file with supporting details.

### Can I update an existing layer presentation in iMapBC that is not my data?

+ Layer presentations are authored by the custodial business area, therefore you may contact them to discuss your proposed updates.
+ This can be done by getting in touch with a contact listed in the dataset's metadata record.
+ They will then follow the process shown in the [_above_](#how-do-i-update-a-layer-presentation-for-my-dataset).
+ Note that iMapBC allows for symbology changes within a session.

### How can I request a new alternate/subset presentation of data that is not mine?

+ Refer to [_Can I update an existing layer presentation in iMapBC that is not my data?_](#can-I-update-an-existing-layer-presentation-in-iMapBC-that-is-not-my-data).

### How do I arrange for my data to become a permanent layer in iMapBC?

+ DataBC hosts iMapBC as a service for data residing in the BCGW.
   + To publish data in iMapBC, the data must be available in the BCGW.
   + Refer to: [The BC Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)](#the-bc-geographic-warehouse-bcgw) section below.

### How do I make my data available as a WMS/WFS?

+ DataBC hosts WMS/WFS as a service for data residing in the BCGW.
   + To publish data in this service, the data must be available in the BCGW.
   + Refer to: [The BC Geographic Warehouse (BCGW)](#the-bc-geographic-warehouse-bcgw) section below.

## ARCGIS ONLINE (aka AGO, B.C.'s MAP HUB)

### How do I get my data into B.C.'s Map Hub (the Province's cloud instance of ArcGIS Online) ?

+ There are two ways:
   1. Public datasets published to the BC Geographic Warehouse are all made available in ArcGIS Online ([_BC Map Hub_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=DE0602BB42664AA28C9F059D45CC1CC2) as part of the [_BC Geographic Warehouse - Publication Workflow_](dps_bcgw_w.md). 
      1. These datasets are stored in the BC Geographic Warehouse, published as web services and registered as items in B.C.’s Map Hub. These services can then be used in any ArcGIS Online web map (or used by other web mapping platforms that can consume ESRI rest services). 
	  1. In some cases we may replicate BCGW layers to ArcGIS Online; the data is hosted in ArcGIS Online and updated from data sources on a regular schedule to keep it current.  These "hosted layers" can then be used in any ArcGIS Online web map (or used by other web mapping platforms that can consume ESRI rest services).  This is a pattern typically chosen for layers that may see high traffic periods that need to leverage ArcGIS Online’s scalability to meet high traffic demand. 
   1. You may also upload datasets yourself to ArcGIS Online. 
		1. Prior to hosting data in AGO, consider if the data is already available via the public BCGW layers.  If it is already available, do your best to avoid publishing a duplicate layer.  Hosting data in AGO consumes AGO service credits.  If you choose to host data in AGO, make a habit of understanding the size of the feature layer and potential draw on service credits.  B.C.’s Map Hub has an annual allocation of service credits shared by all users of the service.  If we exceed the annual allocation additional service credits must be purchased – the cost of purchased service credits will be passed on to the users of the credits.  The size of a hosted feature layer is listed on its item details page.  For information on what uses service credits in AGO see https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/credits.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_709121D2C7694DCAB9B8592F36F7A5BA.
		2. Data can be published to AGO in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, as well as uploading zipped shapefiles or geodatabases directly to your account.  For more information, see  https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/publish-features.htm

### How do I identify a DataBC Hosted Feature Layer in ArcGIS Online?

+ There are a few Hosted Feature Layers that DataBC supports replicating directly to AGO for high availability and high use to support emergency services.
    + This service is only offered for very limited reasons.
+ The way to easily identify if it is hosted is:
    + The URL listed on the bottom right of a BC Maphub items detail page:
       + https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=397a1defe7f04c2b8ef6511f6c087dbf
    + Includes serviceX in the path, e.g., 
       + https://services6.arcgis.com/ubm4tcTYICKBpist/arcgis/rest/services/...
+ These items are noted as **_Managed by databcfme_**

### How do I identify a DataBC BCGW equivalent Feature Layer in ArcGIS Online?

+ All publicly visible datasets in iMapBC and has a Catalogue record is made available in BC's Maphub through an automated process.
+ These are dynamic services that are live to the BCGW.
+ The way to easily identify if one is a service is:
    + The URL listed on the bottom right of a BC Maphub items detail page:
        + https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9531eda4829945f683393841b2b92c21
    +  Includes https://maps.gov.bc.ca/arcserver/rest/services/whse/... in the path
+ These items are noted as  **_Managed by Province.Of.British.Columbia_**

### Why would I publish data to ArcGIS Online only and not to the BCGW?

+ Datasets can be uploaded directly to B.C.’s Map Hub.  This is a common pattern when:
	+	it is not desirable to make the data accessible via the multiple channels available for BCGW-hosted data (e.g., iMapBC, WMS/WFS, Data Distribution, Open Government Licence - BC licensing).
	+	publishing directly is an interim solution while preparing to model/load data to BCGW.
 + The following table summarizes the benefits of each of the two options:

|Feature|ArcGIS Online|BC Geographic Warehouse|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Has a metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue|Yes (if shared to public)|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded in their entirety from the BC Data Catalogue|No|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded by specified area|No|Yes|
|Datasets can be uploaded/stored free of charge|Yes (unless additional service credits are required)|Sometimes|
|Datasets can be secured for viewing by only named users|Not yet (planned in future)|Yes|
|Datasets can be secured for download by only named users|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be permanent layers in iMapBC and the Layer Library|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be available through WMS/WFS services|Yes (possible via AGO, may be limited)|Yes| 
|Datasets with personal information can be stored|No|Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/5/create/16) to discuss options|
|Datasets with sensitive information (excluding personal information) can be stored|Yes, if the data custodian agrees.|Yes|
|Datasets can be made available in an open format|Not at this time|Yes|

### How do I publish a map to ArcGIS Online so it's viewable to the public?

+ Sharing content to public via B.C.’s Map Hub is a privilege reserved for ArcGIS Online administrators.
+ Making ArcGIS Online content available to the public requires a [checklist](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/geographic/web-based-mapping/bc-map-hub/bcs_map_hub_public_publication_checklist.docx) to be completed and approved by the director of the business area responsible for the content (i.e., the Data Custodian).
+ Metadata is required for ArcGIS Online hosted datasets when they are shared to public.  BC Data Catalogue records and ArcGIS Online item details pages must be populated as per the procedures described at [BC Map Hub](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=DE0602BB42664AA28C9F059D45CC1CC2
iv.	For more information on the workflow to share content to public from ArcGIS Online please see:  https://www.yammer.com/gov.bc.ca/threads/1207288411

## THE BC GEOGRAPHIC WAREHOUSE (BCGW)

### How do I publish data to the BCGW? Who do I contact at DataBC to publish my data to the BCGW?

+ Refer to: [_BC Geographic Warehouse - Publication Workflow_](dps_bcgw_w.md).

### How long does it take to publish to the BCGW?

The length of time it takes is dependent on many factors but can take anywhere from a few weeks to many.

To help reduce delays in your data publication, review [Data Publication - Am I Ready?](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/dps_bcgw_w.md#data-publication---am-i-ready) to understand more about how to prepare for publishing data to the BCGW:

### What data service formats can be made available for my BCGW data?

### What is the LRDW?
+ If you remember or frequently refer to the LRDW, then you've probably been around for a while. The LRDW or Land and Resource Data Warehouse, is the historic name for what is now the BCGW or the BC Geographic Warehouse. 

-------------------------------------------------------

### Refreshing Data - the ETL Process

#### What is ETL?

+ _ETL_ stands for **Extract, Transform, Load**.  
+ Extracting data from a source system, possibly performing some operations on the data, and then loading the result into the BCGW. 
+ Within DataBC, _ETL_ is also referred to as _replication_.

#### How is a dataset replicated to the BCGW?

+ Data is replicated to the BCGW using different products that suit the specific architecture of the data.

#### Where can datasets be replicated from?

##### BCGW Staging Area

+ The BCGW Staging Area is a permanent location managed by DataBC to allow the transfer of file based data that is publication ready to be replicated to the BC Geographic Warehouse.

##### BC Data Catalogue file store

+ The BC Data Catalogue can store CSV, XLSX, JSON, and zipped shapefiles as long as their size is less than 150 MB. 
+ Such files can be used as sources for the replication process.

##### A RESTful Web Service

+ RESTful Web Services allow data to be transferred between systems using the HTTP protocol. 
+ A RESTful API is an application program interface that, among other things, can allow a user to fetch data from a source system by navigating to a URL in a web browser.  
+ The BC Data Catalogue is built using a Restful API called the CKAN API. 
+ Some datasets in the BCGW are replicated from source systems using RESTful web services.  

##### An Operational Database

+ A source database managed by a business area with a (BCGW-ready) table or view to be replicated to the BCGW.

#### How often is my dataset refreshed in the BCGW?

+ Refresh schedules are determined in consultation with the Data Manager. The frequency may be anywhere from hourly to annually, depending on consumption requirements and how often the source data changes. "On request" replications are also supported.

#### How do I request that my dataset be refreshed (outside the normal schedule)?

+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/5/create/31) to refresh your dataset.

#### How do I get the scheduled refresh frequency changed?

+ The refresh frequency of a dataset may change over its lifecycle. This can be altered as needed to meet the business requirements. 
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/5/create/31) to change the refresh schedule.

#### How do I determine the source of a dataset in the BCGW?

+ A custodial business area or delegate can open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/14) with the subject line **Request: Source of Dataset in BCGW**, providing the url of the dataset(s) metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue. 
+ As folks move around government or retire, at times the knowledge of the data flow may become unknown to a data provider. 
+ The DataBC Architecture Services team can assist with understanding how the data gets from source to the BCGW.

#### How do I change where my dataset is being replicated from?

+ Sources of datasets that are published into the BCGW change during its lifecycle and as such automated replication platforms will need to be updated to meet the new data management configuration. It is recommended to engage with DataBC early on when changing a source format as we can move alongside during the development, testing and finalization process.
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/5/create/31) to change where your dataset is being replicated from. 

### How do I determine the last refresh date for dataset in the BCGW?

+ Depending on the model of the dataset/table in the BCGW, it can be challending to determine this when things are joined together. Thus we have built an internal process to derive the last refresh or reload date (some datasets only replicate if changed, others are a full truncate and load).
+ This process then writes to the BC Data Catalogue and populates via a rest endpoint to the `last_modified` field at the resource level where it has a matching Object Name (`object_name`) populated.
+ This field you can see via the catalogue API and currently working to make visible on the UI.
    + See the [API common calls page](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/dps_bcdc_api_w_common_calls.html) for examples of using `package_show` to show all metadata fiedls as well as other calls.

-------------------------------------------------------

### Access security

#### How do I change the security for my dataset in the BCGW?

+ The security of a dataset may change over time with its lifecycle. 
   + Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/5/create/31) to change the data model, with the subject line **Request: Update security for a dataset in the BCGW**, providing the url of the dataset(s) metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue. 
   + Altering a security profile will potentially include changes to BCGW Oracle Grants, iMapBC/IMF2, Distribution and its metadata in the BC Data Catalogue.

-------------------------------------------------------

### Downloading data from the BC Geographic Warehouse

#### How do I make something downloadable from the BCGW?

+ A custodial business are may choose to make datasets in the BCGW under their authority downloadable. Data can be downloaded using either the BC Data Catalogue or iMapBC.
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/14) with the subject line **Request: Update distribution for a dataset in the BCGW**, providing the url of the dataset(s) metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue. 
Security options are:
     1. Public download
     1. Download when authenticated with a valid IDIR
     1. Download when authenticated with a valid IDIR or Business BCeID
     1. Download when authenticated with a specific IDIR
     1. Download when authenticated with a specific IDIR or Business BCeID

#### I download data frequently, can I find my past orders?

+ This option is available for users who log in to iMapBC or the BC Data Catalogue when downloading datasets.

-------------------------------------------------------

### Feature Codes

#### How do I get a Feature Code (FCODE) created/updated?

+ Feature Codes or FCODEs are no longer mandatory in the BCGW, there are however still cases where these are needed.
+ To obtain a new FCODE, please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/14) with the subject line **Request: FCODE for a dataset in the BCGW**, providing the url of the dataset(s) metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue. 

#### Do I really need Feature Codes?

+ Feature Codes or FCODEs are not mandatory in the BCGW but they are still useful to delineate features in a dataset.
+ Datasets that only contain one type of information do not need an FCODE.
+ Datasets that already have FCODEs that are used to separate and symbolize different values, it is recommend to create an FCODE when a new value is then created.
+ Refer to [_How do I get an Feature Code (FCODE) created/updated?_](#how-do-i-get-a-feature-code-fcode-createdupdated)

-------------------------------------------------------

### Retiring datasets from the BC Geographic Warehouse

#### How do I retire a dataset from the BCGW?

+ Refer to the [Data Retirement Workflow](dps_bcgw_w_data_retirement.md) for retirement process details.

#### Where is the list of past retirement notifications?

+ Refer to the [Data Retirement Workflow](dps_bcgw_w_data_retirement.md) for retirement process details.

#### How do I retire data and/or a proxy that is in the BCGW and which is tied to my application?

+ Refer to the [Data Retirement Workflow](dps_bcgw_w_data_retirement.md) for retirement process details.

## DOWNLOADING DATA

### Why is there no data in my AOI (Area of Interest) when I download data?

+ You are likely attempting to download non-spatial data as a spatial file (i.e., fdgb or shapefile). Try downloading as a csv instead.
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/30) if you continue to experience issues.

### After I receive notification that my data has been assembled, there are no files in the directory.

+ There may be firewall limitations on your end that prevent you from accessing the data. Try accessing the file(s) using a public wifi connection.
+ Large orders have a time delay built in to the process. You may have received notification that your order has been assembled, but it may still be working away at zipping up the data for you.  Try again in 5 minutes. 
+ Please open a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/30) if you continue to experience issues.
