# **BC Data Catalogue API**

The BC Data Catalogue is built using an open source data portal software called [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/master/README.rst). 
Some users may prefer to use the API to manage thier content in the BC Data Catalogue, while others may prefer to use the application itself. 
This page provides guidance on the use of the Catalogue API to manage resources and data within the BC Data Catalogue.

\* You do not need an API key nor an account if you are only accessing publicly available data. All records published under the Open Government Licence - British Columbia and its variations are publicly available.

If you have questions about accessing data in the B.C. Data Catalogue, please submit a support request via our [request portal](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).
