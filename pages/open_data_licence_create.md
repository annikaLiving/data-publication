# Create an Open Government Licence

The Broader Public Sector (BPS) may publish records in the B.C Data Catalogue but is not permitted to use the OGL-BC and thus must create their own. Other organizations may also use this as a template. These are suggested steps to create an Open Government Licence for your organization.

## Create a copy of the licence
Copy our [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61), as it is consistent with Federal and other Local Governments
+ examples: [**BC Assessment**](https://info.bcassessment.ca/pages/opengovernmentlicencebcassessment.aspx) and [**Elections BC**](https://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/EBC-Open-Data-Licence.pdf)

## MODIFY THE LICENCE
Modify the following text to suit your organization. The following example uses the BC Energy Regulator.
### *Licence Name*
Change the licence name from `Open Government License – British Columbia` to `Open Government License – BC Energy Regulator`
+ This name should be the same that is found on the [B.C. List of Agencies, Crown Corps, etc](https://www.bcpublicsectorboardapplications.gov.bc.ca/s/directoryofagencies)

### Change the name of the licence in the text:
Change all references of `Open Government Licence - British Columbia` to match your organization.

+ In this example, change from 
	+ *Contains information licensed under the `Open Government Licence – British Columbia`* to 
	+ *Contains information licensed under the `Open Government Licence – BC Energy Regulator`*

### Information Provider change:
Change the *Information Provider* to suit your organization:
+ In this example 
	+ _`means Her Majesty the Queen/His Majesty the King in right of the Province of British Columbia.`_ to
	+ _`means B.C Energy Regulator.`_

### Versioning change:
We recommend using `version 1.0` as a starting number
+ In this example: 
	+ _`This is version 2.0 of the Open Government Licence for Government of British Columbia Information.`_ to
	+ _`This is version 1.0 of the Open Government Licence for BC Energy Regulator Information.`_

### (Optional)Note: remove the section on BC Government Copyright or whole line:
Add a note to indicate the jurisdiction of your licence
+ In this example: 
	+ Note: as per B.C. Government Copyright, the following licence only applies to records in the B.C. Data Catalogue that specifies it.

## Publish the licence 
Publish the OGL to a public site so that it can add it to the drop down list of licence options.
