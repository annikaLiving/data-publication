# CREATING AN OPEN GOVERNMENT LICENCE

The Broader Public Sector (BPS) may publish records in the BC Data Catalogue but is not permitted to use the OGL-BC and thus must create their own. These are suggested steps to create an Open Government Licence for your organization. Other organizations may also use this as a template.

|**AUDIENCE**|
|:---:|
| *Data Publishers in the Broader Public Sector (BPS)* |

## CREATE A COPY OF THE LICENCE
Copy our [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61), as it is consistent with Federal and other Local Governments
+ examples: [**BC Assessment**](https://info.bcassessment.ca/pages/opengovernmentlicencebcassessment.aspx) and [**Elections BC**](https://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/EBC-Open-Data-Licence.pdf)

## MODIFY THE LICENCE
Modify the identified text to personalize it for your org. The following uses the BC Energy Regulator as an example.
1. **Licence Name** change:
	+ _‘Open Government License – British Columbia’_ to
	+ _‘Open Government License – BC Energy Regulator’_
		+ This name should be the same that is found on the [BC List of Agencies, Crown Corps, etc](https://www.bcpublicsectorboardapplications.gov.bc.ca/s/directoryofagencies)
1. Change the name of the licence in the text:
	+ _‘Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence – British Columbia.’_ to
	+ _‘Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence – BC Energy Regulator’_.
1. **Information Provider** change:
	+_‘means Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia.’_ to
	+ ‘means BC Energy Regulator.’_
1. **Versioning** change:
	+ _‘This is version 2.0 of the Open Government Licence for Government of British Columbia Information.’_ to
	+ _‘This is version 1.0 of the Open Government Licence for BC Energy Regulator Information.’_
1. **Note**: remove section on BC Government Copyright or whole line:
	+ _'Note: as per B.C. Government Copyright, the following licence only applies to records in the B.C. Data Catalogue that specify it.'_

## PUBLISH THE LICENCE 
Publish the OGL to a public site so that it can add it to the drop down list of licence options.
