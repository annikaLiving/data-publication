<h1>Roles and Responsibilities</h1>

Publishing new or modifing existing BC Geographic Warehouse objects requires coordination between multiple partners including DataBC staff, the client, and the contractor involved (if applicable). 

This page describes the roles and responsibilities of DataBC and the client when publishing data to the BC Geographic Warehouse.
